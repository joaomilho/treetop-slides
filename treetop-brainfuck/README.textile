h1. Brainfuck interpreter in Ruby

It was made with Treetop. Alpha...

h2. What's in it?

Well, it has a 763 bytes brainfuck interpreter written in Ruby with Treetop. Kinda large, but better than most other ruby brainfuck interpreters, but the most important, it is _extremelly_ easy to understand if you're learning TreeTop.

It also has as string to brainfuck converter.

h2. Usage

Running a brainfuck file:

./runbrainfuck code/hello_world.bf

Piping:

cat code/hello_world.bf | ./runbrainfucke

Text to brainfuck:

./txt2bf "foo bar baz"

Text to brainfuck to text again:

./txt2bf "foo bar baz" | ./runbrainfucke

h2. Future plans

Create ebf (embedded brainfuck), and create a revolutionary MVC web framework named "Brainfuck on Rails". Just kidding.

h2. License

You can use it, but you _have_ to say it's yours.
